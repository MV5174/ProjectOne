# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
  People looking for recipes to cook, who dont know how to cook, or finding a restaurant that serves what they're looking for
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
  People not knowing how to cook and not knowing local areas that serve what theyre looking for
  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
  Find recipes and local restaurants for the user
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
  As a user i want to be able to find detailed recipes with the ingredients in my fridge, as a user i want to be able to find new recipes to try, and as a user i want to be able to find local restaurants that serve the dishes and type of food im looking for.

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
